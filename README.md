# PIR-Sensor-based-Burglar-Alarm-with-SMS-Alert
The circuit senses the intrusion using a PIR sensor and sends a SMS to the given mobile number when an intrusion occurs. The intrusion taken place is also displayed on an LCD display. An 8051 microcontroller is used for monitoring the PIR sensor and sending the alert message using the GSM module. An alarm is also raised when an intrusion occurs.
